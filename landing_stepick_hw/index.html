            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out to hoard
                and sell your most personal data.

                What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge has turned into a
                money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.

                But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple:
                An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered by universal compression,
                accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption.

                Put even simpler — it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</p>

            <p>We’re in this together! All of our computers and phones join in a network to make the strongest
                supercomputer the world has ever seen.</p>
